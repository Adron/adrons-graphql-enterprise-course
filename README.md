This is GraphQL course curriculum, course work, and related assets focused around Spring Boot Java GraphQL APIs.

1. Introduction to GraphQL
    - What is GraphQL and why is it useful?
    - Comparison with REST APIs
    - Building blocks: Schema, Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions
2. GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)
    - Scalar types (String, Int, Float, Boolean, etc.)
    - Object types and fields
    - Query and mutation types
    - Input types
    - Enum types
3. GraphQL Queries
    - Query structure and syntax
    - Querying fields and nested fields
    - Arguments and variables in queries
    - Aliases and fragments
    - Querying related data with connections
4. GraphQL Mutations
    - Creating, updating, and deleting data with mutations
    - Input types in mutations
    - Mutation response types and error handling
    - Batch mutations
    - Optimistic UI updates with mutations
5. GraphQL Subscriptions
    - Real-time data updates with subscriptions
    - Subscribing to data changes
    - Setting up a subscription server
    - WebSocket protocols for subscriptions
    - Handling subscription events on the client
6. Pagination and Filtering
    - Implementing pagination with cursors and limits
    - Filtering data with arguments
    - Sorting results
    - Relay pagination specification
7. Authentication and Authorization
    - Securing GraphQL APIs
    - Authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
    - Protecting queries and mutations with authorization rules
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Handling authentication errors
8. Performance and Caching
    - Efficient data fetching with GraphQL
    - Data loader pattern for batch loading
    - Caching GraphQL responses
    - Optimizing resolver functions
    - Pagination and batching strategies
9. Advanced Topics
    - Schema stitching and federation
    - Custom directives
    - Error handling and validation
    - Introspection and schema introspection
    - GraphQL tooling and libraries (Apollo, Relay, etc.)

Example scenarios for each topic will vary depending on the application domain, but here are some general examples:

- Topic: GraphQL Queries Example: Retrieving a user's profile information and their associated posts and comments.
- Topic: GraphQL Mutations Example: Creating a new user account with the provided email and password.
- Topic: GraphQL Subscriptions Example: Subscribing to real-time updates for a chat application.
- Topic: Pagination and Filtering Example: Fetching paginated lists of products with filtering options like category and price range.
- Topic: Authentication and Authorization Example: Authenticating a user and allowing access to certain resources based on their role.
- Topic: Performance and Caching Example: Optimizing the fetching of related data by using data loaders and caching strategies.
    
These examples should help provide a practical understanding of each topic while demonstrating the power and flexibility of GraphQL.
