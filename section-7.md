- Example scenario:
    - Connecting a GraphQL server to a PostgreSQL database for data retrieval and modification

## Example Scenario: E-commerce Application

Consider an e-commerce application that requires integration with different backend technologies and databases. The GraphQL API allows users to query and mutate data related to products, orders, and user management.

## 7.1 Integrating GraphQL with Node.js

- Explanation: Node.js provides an efficient runtime for building scalable GraphQL servers. Express.js can be used as the web framework to set up the server.
- Example: Building a GraphQL server using Node.js and Express.js for the e-commerce application.

## 7.2 Integrating GraphQL with Python

- Explanation: Python is a popular backend technology for building GraphQL servers. Flask, a lightweight web framework, can be used to set up the server.
- Example: Building a GraphQL server using Python and the Flask framework to handle queries and mutations for product management.

## 7.3 Integrating GraphQL with Java

- Explanation: Java is a widely adopted language for backend development. The Spring Boot framework provides a convenient way to set up a GraphQL server.
- Example: Building a GraphQL server using Java and the Spring Boot framework to handle user management and authentication for the e-commerce application.

## 7.4 Integrating GraphQL with Ruby

- Explanation: Ruby is known for its simplicity and readability. Ruby on Rails, a popular web framework, can be used to set up a GraphQL server.
- Example: Building a GraphQL server using Ruby on Rails to handle order management and payment processing in the e-commerce application.

## 7.5 Integrating GraphQL with Database Systems

- Explanation: GraphQL can be integrated with various database systems, including both relational and NoSQL databases, to fetch and modify data.
- Example: Connecting the GraphQL server to a PostgreSQL database for retrieving product information and updating inventory levels in the e-commerce application.

By covering these curriculum topics and providing examples within the context of an e-commerce application, students will gain a practical understanding of integrating GraphQL with different backend technologies and databases.
