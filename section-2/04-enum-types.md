GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

In GraphQL, enum types are used to define a specific set of possible values for a field or an argument. Enum types allow you to restrict the acceptable values and ensure type safety in your GraphQL schema. They provide a way to represent a finite list of options or choices.

1. Enum Types:
    
    - Enum types are defined using the `enum` keyword in the GraphQL SDL.
    - They represent a set of predefined values that a field or an argument can have.
    - Enum types can only have scalar values, and each value must be unique within the enum type.
2. Defining Enum Types:
    
    - Enum types are defined by specifying the name and listing the possible values within the curly braces `{}`.
    - Each value is written in uppercase letters and can include underscores if needed.
    
    Example:
    
``` json
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  USER
  MODERATOR
}
```
    
    In this example, the `UserRole` enum type is defined with values such as "ADMIN", "USER", and "MODERATOR".
    
3. Using Enum Types:
    
    - Enum types can be used to define the type of a field or an argument.
    - Fields can have an enum type, specifying that the field can only have one of the specified enum values.
    - Arguments can also be of an enum type, restricting the acceptable values that clients can provide.
    
    Example:
    
``` json
type User {
  name: String
  role: UserRole
}

type Query {
  getUsersByRole(role: UserRole): [User]
}
```
    
    In this example, the `User` object type has a field called "role" of type `UserRole`, representing the user's role. The `getUsersByRole` query field accepts an argument "role" of type `UserRole`, allowing clients to filter users based on their role.
    
4. Type Safety and Documentation:
    
    - Enum types provide type safety because the GraphQL schema defines a specific set of acceptable values.
    - GraphQL tools and editors can leverage the enum type information to provide auto-completion and validation.
    - Enum types can also include descriptions for each value to document their meaning or usage.
    
    Example:
    
``` json
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  USER
  MODERATOR

  ADMIN_DESCRIPTION: "Administrator role with full access"
  USER_DESCRIPTION: "Regular user role"
  MODERATOR_DESCRIPTION: "Moderator role with limited privileges"
}
```
    
    In this example, descriptions are added to each enum value, providing additional information about the role.
    

Enum types are useful for representing a finite set of values in a GraphQL schema. They ensure type safety, restrict the acceptable values for fields and arguments, and provide self-documented options for clients. By using enum types, you can define and enforce a predefined set of choices within your GraphQL API.
