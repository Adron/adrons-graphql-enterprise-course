GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

In GraphQL, query and mutation types are root types used to define the entry points for querying and mutating data in a GraphQL schema. They provide the structure and functionality for clients to retrieve and modify data.

1. Query Type:
    
    - The query type is a special root type in GraphQL that defines the entry points for retrieving data from a GraphQL API.
    - The query type is mandatory in a GraphQL schema and is defined using the `type` keyword followed by the name "Query" in the SDL.
    - Within the query type, fields are defined that represent the available queries that clients can execute.
    - Each field within the query type corresponds to a specific query operation that clients can perform.
    
    Example:
    
``` json
type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
  getAllPosts: [Post]
}
```
    
    In this example, the query type is defined with fields such as "getUser" and "getAllPosts". The "getUser" field accepts an ID argument and returns a "User" object, while the "getAllPosts" field returns a list of "Post" objects.
    
2. Mutation Type:
    
    - The mutation type is another root type in GraphQL that defines the entry points for modifying data in a GraphQL API.
    - The mutation type is optional in a GraphQL schema and is defined using the `type` keyword followed by the name "Mutation" in the SDL.
    - Similar to the query type, fields are defined within the mutation type, representing the available mutation operations that clients can execute.
    - Each field within the mutation type corresponds to a specific mutation operation that clients can perform.
    
    Example:
    
``` json
type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User
  updatePost(id: ID!, input: PostInput): Post
}
```
    
    In this example, the mutation type is defined with fields such as "createUser" and "updatePost". The "createUser" field accepts name and email arguments and returns a "User" object. The "updatePost" field accepts an ID argument and a complex input object of type "PostInput" and returns a "Post" object.
    
3. Execution of Queries and Mutations:
    
    - Clients execute queries and mutations by sending requests to the GraphQL server with the desired operation.
    - For queries, clients specify the fields they want to retrieve and can traverse relationships between objects.
    - For mutations, clients specify the fields they want to modify and provide input values to describe the changes.
    - The server's resolver functions associated with the query and mutation fields are responsible for handling the request and returning the requested data or performing the specified modifications.

By defining query and mutation types in a GraphQL schema, you establish the entry points and operations that clients can use to interact with the API. The query type defines the available fields for fetching data, while the mutation type defines the available fields for modifying data. These root types provide a structured and consistent way for clients to query and mutate data in a GraphQL API.
