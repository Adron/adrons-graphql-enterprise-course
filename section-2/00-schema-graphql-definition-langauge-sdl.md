GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

In GraphQL, scalar types are the fundamental building blocks that represent the most basic data types. They are used to define and represent primitive values within a GraphQL schema. GraphQL provides a set of predefined scalar types, and it also allows you to define custom scalar types.

1. Predefined Scalar Types: GraphQL provides the following predefined scalar types:
    
    - Int: A signed 32-bit integer.
    - Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value.
    - String: A UTF-8 character sequence.
    - Boolean: Represents true or false.
    - ID: A unique identifier, often used as a primary key.
2. Using Scalar Types: Scalar types are used in field definitions to specify the type of the data that the field returns. For example, a field "name" can be defined with the scalar type "String" to represent a person's name.
    
    Example:
``` json
type Person {
  name: String
  age: Int
  isStudent: Boolean
}
```
    
    In this example, the "name" field is of type String, the "age" field is of type Int, and the "isStudent" field is of type Boolean.
    
3. Custom Scalar Types: GraphQL allows you to define custom scalar types to represent specialized data types specific to your application. Custom scalar types are useful when you have domain-specific data formats or need to enforce specific validation rules.
    
    To define a custom scalar type, you can use the `scalar` keyword in the SDL. You need to specify the name of the scalar type and provide custom parsing and serialization functions.
    
    Example:
``` json
scalar Date

type Event {
  name: String
  date: Date
}
```
    
    In this example, a custom scalar type "Date" is defined. The "date" field in the "Event" type is of type "Date".
    
    Custom scalar types allow you to define specific behavior for parsing input values and serializing output values. For example, a "Date" scalar type can parse a string input value and convert it into a Date object and serialize a Date object into a string for output.
    
4. Built-in Coercion: GraphQL has built-in coercion rules that automatically attempt to convert input values to the expected scalar type. For example, a string "123" can be coerced into an Int if the field expects an Int.
    
    However, if the coercion fails, GraphQL returns an error, indicating that the input value is invalid for the specified scalar type.
    

Scalar types are the basic data types used in GraphQL schemas to represent and validate primitive values. They provide a foundation for defining field types and input values in a GraphQL schema. Predefined scalar types cover common data types, and custom scalar types offer flexibility for handling specialized data formats or validation requirements.
