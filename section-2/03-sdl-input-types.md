GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

In GraphQL, input types are used to define complex input structures that can be passed as arguments to mutation fields. They allow clients to provide structured data to modify or create resources in a GraphQL API. Input types are defined using the `input` keyword in the GraphQL SDL.

1. Input Types:
    - Input types are specially designated types used for passing structured data as arguments to mutation fields.
    - They are similar to object types but are specifically intended for input purposes and cannot have fields that are themselves input types.
    - Input types can contain scalar types, other input types, or lists of those types.
2. Defining Input Types:
    - Input types are defined using the `input` keyword in the GraphQL SDL.
    - Fields within the input type represent the input arguments that clients can provide.
    - Fields within an input type can be of scalar types, other input types, or lists of those types.
    
    Example:

``` yaml
input CreateUserInput {
  name: String!
  email: String!
  age: Int
}
```
    
    In this example, the `CreateUserInput` input type is defined with fields such as "name", "email", and "age". The "name" and "email" fields are required (denoted by the exclamation mark "!"), while the "age" field is optional.
    
3. Using Input Types in Mutations:
    
    - Input types are primarily used as argument types for mutation fields.
    - By defining an input type as an argument for a mutation field, clients can provide structured data when performing mutations.
    
    Example:
    
``` css
type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): User
}
```
    
    In this example, the `createUser` mutation field accepts an argument called "input" of type `CreateUserInput`. The exclamation mark "!" denotes that the "input" argument is required. The field returns a `User` object.
    
4. Complex Input Types:
    
    - Input types can also be composed of other input types to create more complex structures.
    - This allows for nesting and representing hierarchical or deeply structured data.
    
    Example:
    
``` less
input PostInput {
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: CreateUserInput!
}
```
    
    In this example, the `PostInput` input type is defined with fields such as "title", "content", and "author". The "author" field is an input type itself (`CreateUserInput`), allowing clients to provide the necessary data to create a user as part of creating a post.
    

Input types provide a way to pass structured data as arguments to mutation fields in a GraphQL API. They allow clients to provide input for creating or modifying resources. By defining input types in the GraphQL SDL, you can enforce required and optional fields and create complex input structures to represent the necessary data for performing mutations.
