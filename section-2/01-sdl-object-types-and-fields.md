GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

In GraphQL, object types and fields are key components used to define and structure the data in a GraphQL schema. They play a crucial role in determining the available data and operations that clients can query or mutate.

1. Object Types:
    
    - Object types are the building blocks of a GraphQL schema. They represent the entities or concepts in your application, such as "User", "Product", or "Post".
    - Object types are defined using the `type` keyword in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).
    - Object types consist of a collection of fields, which define the properties or characteristics of the object.
    - Fields within an object type can be of any scalar type, another object type, or a list of scalar types or object types.
    
    Example:
    
```
type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
  email: String
  age: Int
}

```
    
    In this example, the "User" object type is defined with fields such as "id", "name", "email", and "age".
    
2. Fields:
    
    - Fields represent the properties or data associated with an object type in a GraphQL schema.
    - Fields are defined within the object type and describe the data that can be queried or mutated.
    - Each field has a name and a type, which can be a scalar type, an object type, or a list of types.
    - Fields can also have additional metadata such as arguments, which allow clients to provide inputs to modify the behavior of the field.
    
    Example:
    
```
type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
  email: String
  age: Int
  posts: [Post]
}

``` 
    
    In this example, the "User" object type has fields such as "id", "name", "email", "age", and "posts". The "posts" field is of type `[Post]`, indicating that it returns a list of "Post" objects.
    
    Fields can also have resolver functions associated with them, which determine how the data for the field is fetched or computed. Resolvers are responsible for resolving the data when a field is queried.
    

Object types and fields form the backbone of a GraphQL schema, defining the structure and properties of the data that clients can access. Object types represent the entities or concepts, while fields define the properties and relationships of those entities. By defining object types and fields, you establish the foundation for constructing complex and hierarchical queries to fetch and manipulate data in a GraphQL API.
