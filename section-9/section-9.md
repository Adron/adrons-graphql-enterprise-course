    - Performing performance tests on a GraphQL API using tools like Artillery or Gatling

## Example Scenario: Task Management Application

Continuing with the task management application introduced earlier, it's essential to ensure that the GraphQL API is thoroughly tested and properly debugged.

9.1 Unit testing GraphQL resolvers

- Explanation: Unit testing resolver functions is crucial to validate their behavior and ensure correctness.
- Example: Writing unit tests for resolver functions like task creation, task update, and task completion to verify their functionality.

9.2 Integration testing GraphQL APIs

- Explanation: Integration testing ensures that the complete flow of queries and mutations in the GraphQL API works as expected.
- Example: Performing integration tests on the GraphQL API by sending GraphQL queries and mutations and verifying the responses.

9.3 Debugging GraphQL queries and mutations

- Explanation: Debugging GraphQL queries and mutations helps identify issues and troubleshoot errors during development.
- Example: Using GraphQL debugging tools or browser extensions to debug and troubleshoot complex queries, ensuring their correctness.

9.4 Error handling and testing error scenarios

- Explanation: Testing error handling ensures that proper error responses are returned for invalid input or exceptional scenarios.
- Example: Writing test cases to validate error handling for scenarios like submitting incomplete task details or unauthorized access attempts.

9.5 Performance testing GraphQL APIs

- Explanation: Performance testing is essential to gauge the scalability and responsiveness of a GraphQL API under different loads.
- Example: Performing performance tests on the GraphQL API using tools like Artillery or Gatling to simulate concurrent user requests and measure response times.

By covering these curriculum topics and providing examples within the context of the task management application, students will gain the necessary skills to test and debug GraphQL applications effectively.
