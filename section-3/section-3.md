# Section 3: GraphQL Queries

## 3.1 Query structure and syntax

- Overview of the structure and syntax of GraphQL queries
- Fields, arguments, and nested fields
- Query aliases
- Example scenario:
    - Writing a simple query to fetch a user's name and email

## 3.2 Querying fields and nested fields

- Exploring how to query specific fields and nested fields in GraphQL
- Fragments for reusability
- Example scenario:
    - Fetching a user's name, email, and their latest post with its title and content

## 3.3 Arguments and variables in queries

- Understanding how to pass arguments to queries and use variables
- Variable definitions and usage
- Example scenario:
    - Querying posts based on specific criteria like category and sorting by date

## 3.4 Aliases and fragments

- Explaining the use of aliases for field renaming
- Fragments for composing reusable selections
- Example scenario:
    - Using aliases to differentiate between two user queries and applying fragments for code reuse

## 3.5 Querying related data with connections

- Fetching related data through connections in GraphQL
- Understanding the concept of edges and nodes
- Pagination and cursor-based navigation
- Example scenario:
    - Querying a user's posts with pagination, including the total count and next/previous page cursors

## Example Scenario: E-commerce Store

Consider an e-commerce store with products, categories, and reviews. The GraphQL API allows users to query for product details, fetch products by category, search for products, and retrieve reviews.

## 3.1 Query structure and syntax

- Explanation: GraphQL queries have a specific structure and syntax that includes fields to request specific data from the server.
- Example: Writing a query to fetch a user's name and email from the server using the user query field.

## 3.2 Querying fields and nested fields

- Explanation: GraphQL allows querying specific fields and nested fields to retrieve precisely the data needed.
- Example: Fetching a user's name, email, and their latest post's title and content by nesting fields in the query.

## 3.3 Arguments and variables in queries

- Explanation: GraphQL queries can accept arguments to customize the requested data. Variables enable dynamic query values.
- Example: Querying posts based on category argument values passed dynamically using variables for flexibility.

## 3.4 Aliases and fragments

- Explanation: Aliases allow renaming fields in a query, while fragments provide reusable selections.
- Example: Using aliases to differentiate between two user queries requesting different fields. Applying fragments to reuse common selections in multiple queries.

## 3.5 Querying related data with connections

- Explanation: Connections in GraphQL facilitate fetching related data efficiently, typically using pagination and cursors.
- Example: Querying a user's posts with pagination, including the total count, and using cursor-based navigation for efficient data retrieval.

By covering these curriculum topics and providing examples within the context of an e-commerce store, students will gain a solid understanding of querying data with GraphQL.
