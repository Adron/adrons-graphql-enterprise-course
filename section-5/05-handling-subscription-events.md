Handling subscription events on the client side involves implementing logic to receive and process real-time updates from the GraphQL server. This section outlines some common ways to handle subscription events on the client and provides examples of key actions to take when receiving updates.

1. Establish WebSocket Connection:
    - Set up a WebSocket connection with the GraphQL server to enable real-time communication.
    - Use WebSocket client libraries or frameworks compatible with your client-side technology, such as Apollo Client, Relay, or custom WebSocket implementations.
2. Subscribe to Events:
    - Send a subscription request to the server, specifying the events or data changes the client wants to receive updates for.
    - Use the appropriate subscription syntax defined by your client-side GraphQL library or framework.
3. Receive Subscription Updates:
    - Handle incoming subscription updates from the WebSocket connection.
    - Implement a callback or event handler to process the updates as they arrive.
4. Update UI or State:
    - Update the user interface or application state based on the received subscription updates.
    - Modify the relevant components or data structures to reflect the changes in real-time.
5. Perform Actions:
    - Trigger specific actions or behaviors in response to subscription events.
    - Examples of key actions to handle on the client side include:
        - Displaying real-time notifications or alerts when certain events occur.
        - Adding new items to a chat conversation or updating message history.
        - Updating charts or visualizations with real-time data points.
        - Synchronizing collaborative editing changes across multiple users.
        - Updating the UI with new data in response to data changes.
6. Handle Errors:
    - Implement error handling logic to handle any errors that may occur during the subscription process.
    - Display appropriate error messages to the user or take necessary actions based on the error type.
7. Graceful Unsubscription:
    - When the client no longer needs to receive updates, unsubscribe from the subscription to stop receiving real-time events.
    - Close the WebSocket connection or use the provided unsubscribe mechanism of your client-side GraphQL library.

By implementing these key actions, you can handle subscription events on the client side effectively. The client will receive real-time updates from the server through the WebSocket connection and take the necessary actions to update the UI, perform specific behaviors, and reflect changes in real-time, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
