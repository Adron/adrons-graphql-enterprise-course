WebSocket protocols are a set of communication protocols that enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers over a single, long-lived connection. In the context of GraphQL subscriptions, WebSocket protocols are commonly used to establish the connection between the GraphQL server and the clients, allowing real-time updates to be delivered.

In Spring Boot for Java, you can set up a WebSocket server to handle GraphQL subscriptions using the following steps:

1. Add Dependencies:
    - In your Spring Boot project, include the necessary dependencies for WebSocket support. The key dependencies are typically `spring-boot-starter-websocket` and `spring-messaging`.
2. Configure WebSocket Endpoint:
    - Create a WebSocket endpoint class that extends `AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` or `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`. This class will handle the WebSocket configuration.
3. Enable WebSocket Message Broker:
    - Override the `configureMessageBroker()` method in the WebSocket endpoint class to enable the WebSocket message broker.
    - Configure the message broker to enable subscriptions by calling `enableSimpleBroker("/topic")` or `enableStompBrokerRelay("/topic")` with appropriate configuration.
4. Define Subscription Resolver:
    - Create subscription resolvers in your GraphQL schema to handle the subscription logic.
    - Implement the subscription resolvers to publish updates to the subscribed clients.
5. Handle WebSocket Subscriptions:
    - Implement a method in the WebSocket endpoint class to handle WebSocket subscription requests from clients.
    - Use the `@MessageMapping` annotation to map the incoming subscription requests to the appropriate method.
6. Publish Updates:
    - Within the subscription resolver methods, publish updates to the subscribed clients.
    - Use the `SimipMessagingTemplate` to send updates to the subscribed clients over the appropriate WebSocket topic.
7. Client-Side Implementation:
    - On the client side, implement the necessary WebSocket connection logic to connect to the server and handle subscription updates.
    - Use WebSocket client libraries or frameworks compatible with Spring Boot, such as SockJS or StompJS.

By following these steps, you can set up a WebSocket server in Spring Boot for Java to handle GraphQL subscriptions. The WebSocket server allows bidirectional communication between the server and clients, enabling real-time updates through the established WebSocket connection.
