# GraphQL Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions enable real-time data updates by establishing a persistent connection between the client and the server. Subscriptions allow clients to subscribe to specific events or data changes and receive updates whenever those events occur. This section explains the concept behind subscriptions and provides an overview of how subscriptions are commonly implemented with Spring Boot for Java.

1. Idea behind Subscriptions:
    
    - Subscriptions extend the capabilities of GraphQL beyond traditional request-response interactions.
    - With subscriptions, clients can receive real-time updates from the server whenever specific events occur or data changes.
    - Subscriptions provide a pub-sub model, where clients subscribe to specific events and the server publishes updates to the subscribed clients.
2. Implementing Subscriptions with Spring Boot for Java:
    
    - Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, provides support for implementing GraphQL subscriptions through various libraries and tools.
    - One commonly used library for implementing GraphQL subscriptions in Spring Boot is `graphql-java-tools` along with the `graphql-java-servlet` library.
    
    Here's an overview of the steps involved in implementing subscriptions with Spring Boot for Java:
    
    a. Configure the GraphQL schema: Define the subscription type in the GraphQL schema to specify the events or data changes that clients can subscribe to.
    
    b. Implement the resolver methods: Create resolver methods that handle the subscription logic. These methods typically use the `graphql-java-tools` library to define the subscription resolvers.
    
    c. Configure the WebSocket endpoint: Configure a WebSocket endpoint in Spring Boot using libraries like `graphql-java-servlet` or `graphql-spring-boot-starter-websocket`. This endpoint enables the communication between the server and the subscribed clients.
    
    d. Publish updates to subscribed clients: In the resolver methods, you can use the WebSocket connection to publish updates to the subscribed clients whenever the corresponding event occurs or data changes.
    
3. Example Subscription Syntax:
    
    javaCopy code
    
``` json
@GraphQLSubscription
public Publisher<Notification> onNewNotification() {
    return notificationPublisher.getPublisher();
}
```
    
    In this example, a subscription resolver method is defined using the `@GraphQLSubscription` annotation. The method returns a `Publisher` that emits `Notification` objects. Whenever a new notification is available, it is published to the subscribed clients.
    

Implementing GraphQL subscriptions with Spring Boot for Java involves configuring the schema, implementing resolver methods, setting up a WebSocket endpoint, and publishing updates to subscribed clients. These steps, combined with the appropriate libraries and tools, enable real-time data updates and event-driven communication between the server and the clients.

The most commonly used libraries and server technology to provide GraphQL subscriptions capabilities in a Spring Boot Java service are:

1. [graphql-java-tools](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-tools): This library is widely used for implementing GraphQL APIs in Java. It provides tools and utilities for defining the GraphQL schema, resolvers, and subscription support.
    
2. [graphql-java-servlet](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-servlet): This library integrates GraphQL with the Servlet API and provides support for handling GraphQL requests and subscriptions over HTTP or WebSocket protocols. It enables the configuration of a WebSocket endpoint for handling subscriptions.
    
3. [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html): Spring WebFlux is a non-blocking, reactive web framework provided by the Spring ecosystem. It is often used in combination with GraphQL subscriptions to handle the WebSocket communication and provide reactive capabilities for real-time data updates.
    
4. [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/) (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol): STOMP is a messaging protocol commonly used with WebSocket connections. It provides a lightweight, text-based format for exchanging messages between clients and servers. Spring WebFlux, along with libraries like `spring-messaging`, can be used to handle STOMP-based WebSocket communication for GraphQL subscriptions.
    

When implementing GraphQL subscriptions in a Spring Boot Java service, a combination of these libraries and technologies is typically used. The `graphql-java-tools` library helps define the schema and resolvers, while `graphql-java-servlet` enables the handling of GraphQL requests and subscriptions. Spring WebFlux, along with WebSocket support and the STOMP protocol, provides the necessary infrastructure for managing real-time updates and communication between clients and the server.
