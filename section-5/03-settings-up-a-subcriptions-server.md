Setting up a subscription server in GraphQL involves configuring the server-side infrastructure to handle and manage subscriptions. This section outlines the general steps to set up a subscription server.

1. Choose a GraphQL Server Implementation:
    - Select a GraphQL server implementation that supports subscriptions. Popular options include Apollo Server, graphql-yoga, and express-graphql.
2. Set Up a WebSocket Server:
    - GraphQL subscriptions typically rely on WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
    - Choose a WebSocket server implementation such as WebSocket API in Node.js or libraries like Socket.IO or GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket (e.g., graphql-ws).
3. Configure the GraphQL Server:
    - Configure the chosen GraphQL server implementation to support subscriptions.
    - Ensure that the server exposes a WebSocket endpoint to handle subscription connections.
4. Define Subscription Types:
    - In the GraphQL schema, define the subscription types that clients can subscribe to.
    - Subscription types specify the events or data changes that clients can listen to.
5. Implement Subscription Resolvers:
    - Implement the resolver functions for the defined subscription types.
    - Subscription resolvers handle the logic for delivering real-time updates to subscribed clients.
6. Set Up the WebSocket Connection:
    - Establish a WebSocket connection between the client and the server.
    - The client-side implementation will depend on the chosen frontend framework or library (e.g., Apollo Client, Relay, or custom WebSocket client).
7. Handle Subscription Requests:
    - On the server, handle incoming subscription requests by connecting clients to the appropriate subscription resolvers.
    - This involves maintaining a mapping of clients to subscriptions and managing the WebSocket connections.
8. Publish Updates to Subscribed Clients:
    - Whenever a relevant event or data change occurs, publish the updates to the clients subscribed to the corresponding subscription.
    - Use the WebSocket connection to send the updates to the subscribed clients in real-time.
9. Graceful Client Disconnection:
    - Handle client disconnections gracefully by cleaning up resources and unsubscribing them from the appropriate subscriptions.
    - Close WebSocket connections and release any associated resources when clients disconnect.

Setting up a subscription server in GraphQL requires choosing a GraphQL server implementation, configuring a WebSocket server, defining subscription types and resolvers, establishing WebSocket connections, handling subscription requests, and publishing updates to subscribed clients. By following these steps, developers can create a subscription server that enables real-time communication and data updates between the server and clients.
