GraphQL Mutations

Batch mutations in GraphQL allow you to perform multiple mutation operations in a single request, reducing network overhead and improving performance. With batch mutations, you can group multiple create, update, or delete operations together, resulting in a more efficient way to modify data. This section explains the concept of batch mutations in GraphQL and provides examples of batch mutation syntax.

1. Batch Mutations in GraphQL:
    
    - Batch mutations enable you to combine multiple mutation operations into a single request.
    - This reduces the number of round trips between the client and server, improving performance.
    - Batch mutations can include a mix of create, update, and delete operations.
2. Example of Batch Mutation Syntax:
    
``` json
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: "John Doe", email: "johndoe@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
  }
  updateUser(id: "123", input: { name: "Jane Smith", email: "janesmith@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
  }
  deleteUser(id: "456") {
    success
  }
}
```
    
    In this example, a batch mutation includes three operations:
    
    - `createUser`: Creating a new user with the provided input values.
    - `updateUser`: Updating the user with the specified ID using the provided input values.
    - `deleteUser`: Deleting the user with the specified ID.
    
    Each mutation operation is written as a separate field within the `mutation` block, allowing multiple operations to be performed in a single request.
    
3. Example of Batch Mutation with Variables:
    
``` json
mutation($input1: CreateUserInput!, $input2: UpdateUserInput!, $id: ID!) {
  createUser(input: $input1) {
    id
    name
  }
  updateUser(id: $id, input: $input2) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
    
    In this example, the batch mutation uses variables to provide the input values dynamically. The variables `$input1`, `$input2`, and `$id` are defined in the mutation block and can be assigned values at runtime.
    

Batch mutations in GraphQL offer a powerful way to optimize data modification operations by combining multiple mutation operations into a single request. By reducing network overhead, batch mutations improve performance and efficiency. The syntax for batch mutations allows you to group different mutation operations together and utilize variables for dynamic input values.
