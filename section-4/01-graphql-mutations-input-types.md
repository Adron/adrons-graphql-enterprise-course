GraphQL Mutations

In GraphQL mutations, input types are used to provide structured and typed input for creating, updating, and deleting data. Input types allow you to define complex input structures with specific fields and their corresponding types. This section explains the concept of input types in GraphQL mutations and provides examples to illustrate their usage.

1. Input Types in Mutations:
    
    - Input types in mutations are used to encapsulate the input values required for a specific mutation operation.
    - Input types are defined in the GraphQL schema and consist of fields with their respective types.
    - When invoking a mutation, you pass an object containing the input values conforming to the defined input type.
2. Example of a Basic Input Type:
    
``` json
input CreateUserInput {
  name: String!
  email: String!
  password: String!
}
```
    
    In this example, the `CreateUserInput` input type is defined with three required fields: `name`, `email`, and `password`. These fields represent the input values needed to create a user.
    
3. Example of an Input Type with Optional Fields:
    
``` json
input UpdateUserInput {
  name: String
  email: String
}
```
    
    In this example, the `UpdateUserInput` input type is defined with optional fields. These fields, such as `name` and `email`, can be included in the input object for updating a user, but they are not required.
    
4. Example of a Complex Input Type:
    
``` json
input CreatePostInput {
  title: String!
  content: String!
  authorId: ID!
  tags: [String!]
}
```
    
    In this example, the `CreatePostInput` input type is defined with various fields. The `tags` field represents an array of strings, where each tag is optional but must not be null if provided.
    

Input types allow you to define structured and typed inputs for mutations in GraphQL. They offer flexibility and validation by specifying required fields and their types, as well as optional fields and complex data structures. By utilizing input types, you can enforce data integrity and improve the clarity of mutation operations.
