GraphQL Mutations

Optimistic UI updates with mutations in GraphQL provide a way to instantly update the user interface with the expected result of a mutation, even before receiving a response from the server. This approach enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback and responsiveness. This section explains the concept of optimistic UI updates with mutations in GraphQL and provides examples of syntax for optimistic UI updates.

1. Optimistic UI Updates in GraphQL:
    
    - Optimistic UI updates allow you to update the user interface optimistically, assuming that the mutation will be successful.
    - These updates are performed locally on the client-side before waiting for the server response.
    - If the actual server response differs from the optimistic update, the UI is reconciled to reflect the server's response.
2. Example of Optimistic UI Update Syntax:
    
``` json
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: "John Doe", email: "johndoe@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
    
    In this example, the mutation creates a new user. With optimistic UI updates, the client-side UI can be updated immediately upon invoking the mutation, assuming that the user creation will be successful. The UI can display the newly created user's information without waiting for the server response.
    
3. Example of Reconciliation:
    
``` json
mutation {
  updateUser(id: "123", input: { name: "Jane Smith", email: "janesmith@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
    
    In this example, the mutation updates a user's information. When performing an optimistic UI update, the client-side UI can be updated instantly with the new information. However, once the server response is received, the UI is reconciled to reflect the actual updated data. If the server response contains different values, the UI is adjusted accordingly.
    

Optimistic UI updates with mutations in GraphQL provide a seamless user experience by instantly updating the UI with expected changes. This approach enhances the perception of speed and responsiveness. It's important to note that reconciliation is necessary to ensure that the UI accurately reflects the server's response, in case the optimistic updates differ from the actual result. By leveraging optimistic UI updates, GraphQL enables a smoother and more engaging user experience.
