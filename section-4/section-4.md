# Section 4: GraphQL Mutations

## 4.1 Creating, updating, and deleting data with mutations

- Overview of mutations in GraphQL for modifying data
- Creating new resources
- Updating existing resources
- Deleting resources
- Example scenario:
    - Creating a new user account with provided email and password

## 4.2 Input types in mutations

- Exploring the use of input types in mutations to pass complex data
- Defining input types for mutations
- Example scenario:
    - Creating a mutation to add a new product with multiple input fields

## 4.3 Mutation response types and error handling

- Understanding the concept of response types in mutations
- Handling success and error scenarios
- Example scenario:
    - Defining a mutation to update a user's profile and handling success and error responses

## 4.4 Batch mutations

- Performing multiple mutations in a single request
- Advantages and considerations of batch mutations
- Example scenario:
    - Creating a batch mutation to add multiple products to a user's cart

## 4.5 Optimistic UI updates with mutations

- Implementing optimistic UI updates to provide a better user experience
- Updating the UI optimistically before receiving the server response
- Example scenario:
    - Optimistically updating the UI when adding a new comment to a post

## Example Scenario: Task Management Application

Consider a task management application where users can create, update, and delete tasks. The GraphQL API allows users to perform mutations to create new tasks, update task details, and delete tasks.

## 4.1 Creating, updating, and deleting data with mutations

- Explanation: Mutations in GraphQL enable creating, updating, and deleting data on the server-side.
- Example: Creating a mutation to register a new user account by providing an email and password.

## 4.2 Input types in mutations

- Explanation: Input types allow passing complex data to mutations in a structured format.
- Example: Defining an input type called TaskInput with fields like title (String) and description (String) to pass as an argument when creating a new task.

## 4.3 Mutation response types and error handling

- Explanation: Mutation response types provide information about the outcome of a mutation operation, including success or error messages.
- Example: Defining a mutation to update a user's profile and handling success and error responses from the server.

## 4.4 Batch mutations

- Explanation: Batch mutations enable performing multiple mutation operations in a single request, reducing network overhead.
- Example: Creating a batch mutation to add multiple tasks to a project in a single request.

## 4.5 Optimistic UI updates with mutations

- Explanation: Optimistic UI updates allow updating the user interface optimistically before receiving the server response, enhancing the user experience.
- Example: Optimistically updating the UI by adding a new comment to a task before the server confirms the operation.

By covering these curriculum topics and providing examples within the context of a task management application, students will gain a solid understanding of performing mutations in GraphQL and handling data modifications.
