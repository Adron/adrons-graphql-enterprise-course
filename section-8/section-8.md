- Setting up a GraphQL client in a React application
- Example scenario:
    - Building a React application that fetches and displays data from a GraphQL API

## 8.2 Integrating GraphQL with Vue.js

- Using GraphQL with Vue.js as the client-side framework
- Setting up a GraphQL client in a Vue.js application
- Example scenario:
    - Building a Vue.js application that performs queries and mutations using GraphQL

## 8.3 Integrating GraphQL with Angular

- Using GraphQL with Angular as the client-side framework
- Setting up a GraphQL client in an Angular application
- Example scenario:
    - Building an Angular application that leverages GraphQL for data retrieval and modification

## 8.4 State management with GraphQL and Apollo Client

- Managing application state using GraphQL and Apollo Client
- Querying and mutating data with Apollo Client's reactive cache
- Example scenario:
    - Implementing state management with Apollo Client in a React application

## 8.5 Real-time updates with GraphQL subscriptions and client-side frameworks

- Leveraging GraphQL subscriptions in client-side frameworks for real-time updates
- Subscribing to data changes and updating the UI in real-time
- Example scenario:
    - Implementing real-time notifications using GraphQL subscriptions in a Vue.js application

## Example Scenario: Task Management Application

Consider a task management application built using a client-side framework. The application allows users to create tasks, update task details, and mark tasks as completed. The GraphQL API provides the necessary data operations for the application.

## 8.1 Integrating GraphQL with React

- Explanation: React is a popular choice for building user interfaces, and integrating GraphQL with React allows efficient data fetching and manipulation.
- Example: Building a React application that fetches and displays tasks from a GraphQL API using GraphQL queries and mutations.

## 8.2 Integrating GraphQL with Vue.js

- Explanation: Vue.js provides a lightweight and intuitive framework for building reactive applications. Integrating GraphQL with Vue.js enables efficient data retrieval and modification.
- Example: Building a Vue.js application that performs GraphQL queries and mutations to manage tasks and their details.

## 8.3 Integrating GraphQL with Angular

- Explanation: Angular is a powerful framework for building complex web applications. Integrating GraphQL with Angular enables efficient data handling and synchronization.
- Example: Building an Angular application that interacts with a GraphQL API to perform CRUD operations on tasks and maintain their state.

## 8.4 State management with GraphQL and Apollo Client

- Explanation: Apollo Client, a GraphQL client library, provides powerful state management capabilities. It allows querying and mutating data while maintaining a reactive cache.
- Example: Implementing state management with Apollo Client in a React application to fetch and update task data while leveraging Apollo Client's cache for optimized performance.

## 8.5 Real-time updates with GraphQL subscriptions and client-side frameworks

- Explanation: Client-side frameworks can utilize GraphQL subscriptions to receive real-time updates and provide a responsive user experience.
- Example: Implementing real-time notifications in a Vue.js application by subscribing to task updates using GraphQL subscriptions.

By covering these curriculum topics and providing examples within the context of a task management application, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of integrating GraphQL with popular client-side frameworks and utilizing advanced features like state management and real-time updates.
